### Where to look for a job?

Networking can do wonders, so try to get in touch with the [community](../../06-education/2-community/index.md) in any way: open-source projects, conferences, courses etc. Don't forget to make a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) profile and join the Facebook group [Tworzenie dokumentacji](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tworzeniedokumentacji).  

Other than that, look for job offers through dedicated websites:  

* [Careerjet](https://www.careerjet.pl/)
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm)
* [Indeed](https://indeed.com/)
* [Jooble](https://pl.jooble.org/)
* [Just Join IT](https://justjoin.it/)
* [No Fluff Jobs](https://nofluffjobs.com/)
* [Pracuj.pl](https://www.pracuj.pl/)
* [Rocket Jobs](https://rocketjobs.pl/)

### How to search?

You probably know by now that technical writers do various things and that there are no uniform naming conventions. To find a job where the tasks reflect what we cover in this guide, try searching for:

* Technical writer
* Technical document writer
* API writer
* Specjalista ds. dokumentacji
* Dokumentalista

To make sure your expectations align with reality, focus on listed responsibilities, not job titles alone. If they mention common technical writing [concepts](../../04-learning-the-basics/index.md) or [tools](../../05-tools/index.md), then it's probably a good bet.  

There are other tech- and content-related jobs out there that you might consider: UX writer, marketing writer, content writer, copywriter, SEO writer, and so on. Who knows, maybe you'll find them more interesting than *technical writing proper* (if this is a thing). They might also be a good starting point for you to get into technical writing later.  

> ❗ **IMPORTANT:** Some employers don't get it quite right; you might see job offers for "technical writers", when in fact they are looking for content writers (or "*technical* content writers – see how confusing it gets?), which without enough context can mean many different things. That is not to say content writing, marketing, SEO, and the like are bad career choices; just make sure you and your recruiters are on the same page.  

### What to expect from the interview?

#### Questions

Apart from typical talk about your motivations, experience, and the like, you can expect questions on field-specific (technical) topics. Those will vary, so look for hints in the requirements. If it's API documentation, then you should probably know what an [endpoint](../../09-glossary/index.md/#e) is. If it's writing docs for a web app, be ready to explain what HTML, HTTP, IP, or the Internet is (sounds easier than it is, right?). If it's corporate process docs, find out more about the company you're applying for; and so on. You get the idea.  

Other questions may concern issues that technical writers, regardless of the sector, deal with on regular basis. Those could be for example:  

* *What types of deliverables do you know and what are they good for?*
* *What would you start a documentation project with?*
* *What do you do if your SME is absent and you need their input?*
* *How would you deal with an SME who is busy or unresponsive?*

Hopefully, if you've read the previous sections, you can answer these by now!  

#### Tasks

In the process of your recruitment, you may be asked to complete certain tasks designed to test your skills. These can take the form of a short exercise during the interview, or a longer assignment to prepare at home. 

An example of the former would be an "ELI5" ("Explain Like I'm Five") description of a technical concept: *API*, *single sourcing*, or similar. Sometimes you may be asked to prepare short instructions for something obvious, e.g., *"how to use a nutcracker?"* or *"how to search for images in Google?"*. Silly as they may sound, these tasks help to determine how well you can recognize and break down steps in a process and how clearly you can organize and present your thoughts.

Longer assignments often concern a specific tool, standard, or technology. A task like this could be to use DITA in OxygenXML to recreate the TOC and folder structure of a PDF you got from the recruiters. In an easier variant, it could be rewriting said document in Markdown or HTML, for example.

Recruiters often check if you can adjust your writing to specific purposes. They can ask you to prepare a user guide for two different personas: one for an engineer and one for the product owner, for example. In this sample scenario, the product to document could be some imaginary software or framework, and you would use a description from your recruiters as an input.

Most of these tasks and questions come from actual, real-life interviews[^1]. We consider junior positions here, though similar scenarios could apply to mid-tier offers. Take this as an encouragement. Don't let job requirements scare you. Some employers list 1-3 years of experience, but may still take you on as long as you have the skill and something to show for it. It's always worth trying. Hit them with your private projects for extra points!
